Before You Start
Here is an example to help you use prompt() and alert():

```javascript
let name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to JavaScript.");
```

##### Uses

- prompt() asks the user to enter a value.
- alert() shows a message box with the output.

#### Exercises

##### Exercise 5: Multiplication Table Generator

**Instruction:**

- Ask the user to enter a number
- Use a for loop to print the multiplication table from 1 to 12
- Use console.log() (not alert)

**Sample Console Output (if user enters 3):**

3 x 1 = 3  
3 x 2 = 6  
...

##### Exercise 7: Guess the Number Game

- Generate a random number between 1 and 5
- Ask the user to guess
- Tell them if they got it right or wrong using alert()

```

##### Exercise 8: FizzBuzz Challenge

**Instruction:**

- Use a for loop to go through numbers from 1 to 15.
- For each number:
- If it's divisible by 3, log "Fizz"
- If it's divisible by 5, log "Buzz"
- If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, log "FizzBuzz"
- Otherwise, log the number itself
- Use console.log() to print the output.

**_Hint_**:

- Use the modulo operator % to check for divisibility.

**Sample Output in Console:**

```cmd
1  
2  
Fizz  
4  
Buzz  
Fizz  
7  
8  
Fizz  
Buzz  
11  
Fizz  
13  
14  
FizzBuzz
```
